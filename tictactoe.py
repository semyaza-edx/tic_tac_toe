# PDX Fullstack: Tic Tac Toe 
# You will write a **Player** class and **Game** class to model Tic Tac Toe, and a function **main** that models gameplay taking in user inputs through REPL.

# The Player class has the following properties: 
#* **name** = *player name*
#* **token** = *'X' or 'O'*
# class Player: <Peter>


# The Game class has the following properties:
# * **board** = *your representation of the board* <Cleon>
# You can represent the board however you like, such as a 2D list, tuples, or dictionary.
# The Game class has the following methods:
# <Leon> * `__repr__()` Returns a pretty string representation of the game board
# * 'move(x, y, player)' place a player's token character at a given coordinate 
# * 'calc_winner()' determines if a victory condition is met by a Player
# * 'is_full()' returns True if the game board is full and no victory condition met
# * 'is_game_over()' returns True if game board is full or a player has won
# class Game:

# def main:

# main()

print("hello, world!")
print("Leon's portion of the game.")
